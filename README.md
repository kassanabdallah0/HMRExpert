# HMRExpert
HMRexpert Printing Plates Analysis Project
Project Overview

During my six-month internship at HMRexpert (February 2022 - July 2022), I was tasked with developing a software application to analyze the quality of printing plates. The project aimed to transition the quality analysis from manual inspection to an automated, software-driven process. The software analyzes printing plates using grid and graining tests to measure the quality of printing, and it was specifically tailored for the Stellantis Group.
Technologies Used

    Programming Languages: Python, PYQT5
    Image Processing: OpenCV
    Data Analysis: Pandas, Matplotlib

Features

    Image Processing: Advanced image processing techniques to accurately detect and analyze the printing plates and the tests conducted on them.
    Automated Analysis: Automated analysis of grid and graining tests to measure printing quality.
    Data Visualization: Utilization of Pandas and Matplotlib for data analysis and result visualization.
    User-Friendly Interface: A user-friendly interface built with PYQT5 for easy interaction with the software.
